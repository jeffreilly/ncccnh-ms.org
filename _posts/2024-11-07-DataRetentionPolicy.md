**Data Retention and Disposal Policy**

**Objective:**
To ensure the responsible stewardship of the church's resources by maintaining strict data retention policies and secure disposal practices, particularly for financial records, in alignment with our mission to serve, protect, and respect the privacy of our members.

**Policy:**

### 1. **Retention Periods for Financial Records:**

- **Donation Records:**
  - Retained for 7 years for tax purposes and to comply with IRS regulations.
  
- **Financial Statements and Budgets:**
  - Permanent retention due to their historical significance and for the continuity of financial oversight.

- **Bank Statements, Receipts, and Expense Records:**
  - Retained for 7 years to align with the statute of limitations for audits.

- **Contracts, Deeds, and Legal Documents:**
  - Permanent retention due to potential legal or property-related implications.

- **Employee and Volunteer Payroll Records:**
  - Retained for 7 years after the end of employment or service.

- **Audit Reports:**
  - Permanent retention, as they provide crucial historical financial context.

### 2. **Secure Storage:**

- All records will be stored in a secure location, either in a locked cabinet within the church office or in a fireproof safe if physical records are kept.
- Electronic records must be stored on secure servers with encryption and regular backups, ideally using cloud services that comply with data protection standards.

### 3. **Access Control:**

- Only authorized personnel, such as the Treasurer, Assistant Treasurer, and designated members of the Board of Trustees, have access to financial records.
- Access to electronic records will be controlled through secure user authentication and password protection.

### 4. **Disposal of Records:**

- **Physical Records:**
  - Documents to be disposed of shall be shredded using a cross-cut shredder or through a professional shredding service to prevent reconstruction.
  - Large volume document destruction might require hiring a certified document destruction company to ensure security.

- **Electronic Records:**
  - Secure erasure methods will be used to delete electronic data, such as:
    - Overwriting the data multiple times or using specialized software for data wiping.
    - Ensuring that backups containing outdated records are also securely erased.
  - Hard drives or other storage media that are no longer needed should be physically destroyed or degaussed (if applicable) before disposal.

- **Confidentiality:**
  - The process of disposal will be carried out in a manner that maintains confidentiality. Employees or volunteers involved in the disposal process must sign confidentiality agreements.

### 5. **Responsibility:**

- The Treasurer and Board of Trustees are responsible for overseeing the implementation of this policy.
- The Data Protection Officer (if appointed) will ensure compliance with data protection regulations concerning retention and disposal.

### 6. **Review and Compliance:**

- This policy will be reviewed annually by the Board of Trustees to ensure it remains compliant with legal requirements and church bylaws.
- Any changes in law or best practices will be incorporated into the policy as needed.

### 7. **Training:**

- Church staff and volunteers involved in financial management will receive training on data handling, retention requirements, and secure disposal methods.

### 8. **Documentation:**

- Logs will be kept of when documents are shredded or electronic data is erased, including the type of document, date of disposal, method used, and who performed the disposal.
