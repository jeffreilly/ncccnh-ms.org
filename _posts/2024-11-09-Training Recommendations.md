Here are some online training recommendations that cater to the requirements for member education and engagement regarding financial and privacy data, tailored to be compliant with New Hampshire privacy laws while being user-friendly:

1. **TeachPrivacy Whiteboard Series**
   - **Cost:** Free for a limited time (as per X post)
   - **Description:** This whiteboard series provides a concise and visual explanation of privacy laws, which can be particularly effective for those who need a quick overview of the New Hampshire Privacy Act. It's designed to be easily digestible, making it suitable for members who might find detailed legal texts challenging.
   - **Why it's good:** The free aspect encourages maximum attendance, and the visual format can be less time-consuming and more engaging.

2. **LRN Ethics and Compliance Training**
   - **Cost:** Varies, but can be customized for affordability (pricing not explicitly stated)

   - **Why it's good:** Personalization options ensure it's not overly complex, and the use of gamified elements can make the training less onerous.

3. **IAPP Introduction to Privacy Training**
   - **Cost:** While exact costs aren't listed, IAPP generally offers courses at reasonable rates for nonprofit organizations or educational discounts.
   - **Description:** The IAPP provides an introductory training that covers privacy basics, which can be aligned with state-specific legislation like New Hampshire's. It's aimed at professionals new to privacy issues or needing a refresher.
   - **Why it's good:** It's designed for entry-level understanding, which fits well for volunteers or staff not deeply involved in privacy compliance daily.

4. **DataPro's Transaction Monitoring System Implementation**
   - **Cost:** â‚¦60,000 (approximately $40-$50 USD depending on exchange rates)
   - **Description:** Although primarily focused on AML/CFT, the training includes components on handling financial data which could be extended to privacy concerns. 
   - **Why it's good:** While not explicitly for privacy law, the financial transaction monitoring aspect relates to data handling and could cover privacy implicitly. The cost is relatively low, making it accessible.

5. **WeltmanLaw's Bank Secrecy Act Training**
   - **Cost:** Complimentary (Free)
   - **Description:** While centered around the Bank Secrecy Act, the training touches on recognizing and reporting fraud, which is relevant to privacy and data handling. It can be adapted to mention state privacy laws like New Hampshire's.
   - **Why it's good:** Being free, it's an excellent choice for maximum engagement. However, you would need to ensure that the training is supplemented with New Hampshire-specific information.

**Implementation Tips:**
- **Customization:** If possible, customize these trainings with specific New Hampshire privacy law components to ensure compliance. Some platforms allow for the addition of custom modules or information sheets.
- **Engagement:** Use interactive elements like quizzes, discussions, or scenarios relevant to your church's operations to keep participants engaged.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the platforms used are user-friendly and accessible, especially for an older demographic which might be less tech-savvy. Clear instructions and support for setup can help maximize attendance.

Remember, while these courses provide a foundation, you might need to add specific content about New Hampshire laws to fully comply. Always check with legal counsel or privacy professionals to ensure the training meets all legal requirements.
